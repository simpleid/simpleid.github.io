## SimpleID web site

This repository contains the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) source code for
the SimpleID web site, hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).  You
can see a much prettier version at http://simpleid.org/.

Currently, the web site is built using a Github Actions script and then pushed
to the `gh-pages` branch, which is then picked up by Github and deployed.
At a later stage, when Github finalises the `actions\deploy-pages` action,
the web site will be deployed directly from this branch.

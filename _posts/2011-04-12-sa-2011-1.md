title: Security advisory SA-2011-1 - Directory traversal vulnerability
date: 2011-04-12 06:58:04
tags: advisory
advisory_id: SA-2011-1
advisory_version: < 0.7.6
advisory_risk: Moderately critical
# Highly Critical. Remotely exploitable vulnerabilities that can compromise the system. Interaction is not normally required for this exploit to be successful. Exploits have occurred to systems. Includes: Local file inclusion on Windows, Impersonation, privilege escalation
# Critical. Remotely exploitable Denial of Service (DOS) vulnerabilities that can compromise the system but do require user interaction. Vulnerabilities that allow may allow anonymous users (i.e. users not registered at the site) to log in as a site user or take administrative actions. Interaction (such as an administrator viewing a particular page) may be required for this exploit to be successful, or in cases where interaction is not required (such as CSRF) the exploit causes only minor damage. Includes: OpenID impersonation, SQL injection
# Moderately Critical. Remotely exploitable vulnerabilities than can compromise the system. Interaction (such as an administrator viewing a particular page) is required for this exploit to be successful. Exploits have not yet occurred on systems when vulnerability was disclosed. The exploit requires the user to be registered at the site and have some non-default permission, such as creating content. Includes: Cross Site Scripting, Access bypass
# Less Critical. Used for cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities as well as privilege escalation vulnerabilities which require complex chains of events. This rating also includes vulnerabilities which might expose sensitive data to local users. Includes: Session fixation, Cross site request forgery
# Not Critical. Rating is used for limited privilege escalation vulnerabilities and locally Denial of Service (DOS) vulnerabilities. Include: Access bypass
advisory_exploitable: Remote # Local or Remote 
advisory_vulnerability: Directory traversal

## Description

User input in the log in page is not properly validated by `www/filesystem.store.inc` before looking for an identity file using the specified user name.  This may lead to a directory traversal vulnerability where an attacker with write access to any part of the server can create an identity file and thus assert any identity URL the attacker can claim.

## Versions affected

### What's new in SimpleID 0.8.1

The version mainly targets bug fixes, minor feature improvements and enhanced compliance with the OpenID specification.

- **Improvements to OpenID extensions.**  SimpleID 0.8.1 provides enhancements to the [Provider Authentication Policy Extension](http://openid.net/specs/openid-provider-authentication-policy-extension-1_0.html) by enabling the provision of private personal identifiers.

- **User interface enhancements,** with enhancements to the redirection code.

- the general [upgrade instructions](http://simpleid.sourceforge.net/documentation/getting-started/upgrading) on this web site; and
- UPGRADE.txt included in the distribution

for upgrade instructions.

### Known Issues

**Please note that while the software may work, it may also have gaping security holes and other nasty bugs. Use at your own risk.**

SimpleID continues to enhance its compliance against the OpenID specification.  This means that SimpleID will report more warnings on web sites which does not fully implement the OpenID specification.  In particular, expect to see many more [return_to discovery failure warnings](http://simpleid.sourceforge.net/documentation/troubleshooting/returnto-discovery-failure).

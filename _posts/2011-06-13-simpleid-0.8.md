Version 0.8 of SimpleID, a simple, personal OpenID provider written in PHP, has been released.

Upgrading to version 0.8 is strongly recommended.  To download, go to [the download page](/download).

**Please note that while the software may work, it may also have gaping security holes and other nasty bugs. Use at your own risk.**

### What's new in SimpleID 0.8

The version mainly targets bug fixes, minor feature improvements and enhanced compliance with the OpenID specification.

- **Implementation of OpenID extensions.**  SimpleID 0.8 provides simple implementations of the [Provider Authentication Policy Extension](http://openid.net/specs/openid-provider-authentication-policy-extension-1_0.html) and [Attribute Exchange Extension](http://openid.net/specs/openid-attribute-exchange-1_0.html) (read-only).

- **User interface enhancements,** including cleaner URLs (if mod_rewrite is installed) and improved HTML compliance.

- Improvements to the back-end code

For further details on the enhancements, please see the [milestone page for this release](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/simpleid/milestone/0.8).

### Installing and Upgrading {#install}

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of SimpleID, please read:

- the general [upgrade instructions](http://simpleid.sourceforge.net/documentation/getting-started/upgrading) on this web site; and
- UPGRADE.txt included in the distribution

for upgrade instructions.

### Known Issues

**Please note that while the software may work, it may also have gaping security holes and other nasty bugs. Use at your own risk.**

SimpleID continues to enhance its compliance against the OpenID specification.  This means that SimpleID will report more warnings on web sites which does not fully implement the OpenID specification.  In particular, expect to see many more [return_to discovery failure warnings](http://simpleid.sourceforge.net/documentation/troubleshooting/returnto-discovery-failure).

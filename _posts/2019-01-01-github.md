title: Migration of primary source repository to Github
categories: ["news"]
---
Since the beginning, [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/simpleid/)
has been used as the SimpleID project's main host, including its source
repository.  A mirror of this repository has been hosted at
[Github](https://github.com/simpleid/simpleid/).

Because there is better support for Github in many continuous integration
systems, as well as better support for pull requests, the primary source
repository will be switching to Github.

In practice, not much will change.  Sourceforge will continue to host a
mirror of the Github repository, as well as hosting release builds.

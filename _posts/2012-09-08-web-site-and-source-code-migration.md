As a result of SourceForge's [hosted apps retirement](http://sourceforge.net/p/forge/community-docs/Hosted%20Apps%20Retirement/), a number of changes have been made to SimpleID's web site and source code management.

The SimpleID web site has been migrated from the SourceForge servers to a private server.  As a result, the URL for SimpleID's web site has changed to [http://simpleid.sourceforge.net/](http://simpleid.sourceforge.net).  Please update your bookmarks accordingly.

In addition, SimpleID's source code has been migrated from Subversion to Git.  Details on accessing the Git repository can be found in the [downloads page](/downloads).

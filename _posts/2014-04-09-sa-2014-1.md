title: Security Advisory SA-2014-1 - OpenSSL "Heartbleed" vulnerability (CVE-2014-0160)
date: 2014-04-09 23:18:43
categories: advisory
advisory_id: SA-2014-1
advisory_version: all versions
advisory_risk: Highly critical
# Highly Critical. Remotely exploitable vulnerabilities that can compromise the system. Interaction is not normally required for this exploit to be successful. Exploits have occurred to systems. Includes: Local file inclusion on Windows, Impersonation, privilege escalation
# Critical. Remotely exploitable Denial of Service (DOS) vulnerabilities that can compromise the system but do require user interaction. Vulnerabilities that allow may allow anonymous users (i.e. users not registered at the site) to log in as a site user or take administrative actions. Interaction (such as an administrator viewing a particular page) may be required for this exploit to be successful, or in cases where interaction is not required (such as CSRF) the exploit causes only minor damage. Includes: OpenID impersonation, SQL injection
# Moderately Critical. Remotely exploitable vulnerabilities than can compromise the system. Interaction (such as an administrator viewing a particular page) is required for this exploit to be successful. Exploits have not yet occurred on systems when vulnerability was disclosed. The exploit requires the user to be registered at the site and have some non-default permission, such as creating content. Includes: Cross Site Scripting, Access bypass
# Less Critical. Used for cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities as well as privilege escalation vulnerabilities which require complex chains of events. This rating also includes vulnerabilities which might expose sensitive data to local users. Includes: Session fixation, Cross site request forgery
# Not Critical. Rating is used for limited privilege escalation vulnerabilities and locally Denial of Service (DOS) vulnerabilities. Include: Access bypass
advisory_exploitable: Remote # Local or Remote 
advisory_vulnerability: Memory leak in OpenSSL library

*Normally, SimpleID security advisories only relate to vulnerabilities found in the SimpleID software.  However, due to the seriousness of this vulnerability, it is reposted here to assist in wide dissemination.*

## Description

A security vulnerability has been reported for the OpenSSL cryptographic library ([CVE-2014-0160](https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt)), popularly known as the [Heartbleed Bug](http://heartbleed.com/).  The vulnerability allows access to sensitive information including user names and passwords entered by users, as well as the private key used to secure communication with the web server.

OpenSSL is used by many web servers to provide SSL/TLS encryption.  If you use SSL/TLS (HTTPS) to encrypt your connection to the SimpleID server, and your web server uses OpenSSL, you may be vulnerable to this attack.

## Versions affected

 * All versions of SimpleID, if SimpleID is accessed using SSL/TLS (HTTPS) and the web server uses OpenSSL for SSL/TLS encryption

## Solution

- Update your web server software.  Further instructions for various Linux distributions can be found below.

    - [Debian](http://www.debian.org/security/2014/dsa-2896)
    - [Fedora](http://fedoramagazine.org/update-on-cve-2014-0160-aka-heartbleed/)
    - [Red Hat Linux](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0376.html)
    - [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2165-1/)

- Revoke old SSL certificates

- Install new SSL certificates with a new private key

- Clear the SimpleID cache directory

- Change the password store in all users' [identity files](/documentation/getting-started/setting-identity/identity-files)

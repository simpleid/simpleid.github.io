Due to delays with Sourceforge's migration of Hosted Apps feature, as well as performance issues with the interim Sourceforge-hosted trac, SimpleID's trac has been moved again to [http://simpleid.koinic.net/trac](http://simpleid.koinic.net/trac).

Content that were missing from the original migration has now been restored, including access to source code.

At this stage, users will not be able to use their Sourceforge account to log in.  You will need to use a Google account or an OpenID to log in and create tickets.

It is likely that this web site will also be migrated to the new server at some stage.

title: Closure of trac.simpleid.koinic.net

For many years, [Trac](https://trac.edgewall.org/) has been used as the
source code browser, issuer tracker and development documentation tool for the
SimpleID project, with the latest being self-hosted at
https://trac.simpleid.koinic.net/.  Trac was chosen at the time due to its
closeness to the Subversion version control system, as well as the lack of a
better solution.

With the source code repository migrated to git and improvements to hosted
issue tracking systems, it is now time to retire Trac in favour of Github.

Existing [developer documentation](https://github.com/simpleid/simpleid/wiki/)
[knowledge base articles](https://github.com/simpleid/simpleid/issues?q=label%3Aknowledgebase)
and [open issues](https://github.com/simpleid/simpleid/issues) have been
migrated to the SimpleID Github project.  SimpleID's source code repository
remains hosted at [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/p/simpleid/code/),
although this is mirrored at [Github](https://github.com/simpleid/simpleid/).
